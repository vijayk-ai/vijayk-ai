<👋 Hi, I’m **Vijay Konangeri**, a QA professional evolving into **AI Quality Engineering**. I specialize in testing, evaluating, and improving AI and LLM-based systems to ensure **accuracy, reliability, and performance**.

I work across AI technologies including:  
**LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, LangGraph, embeddings, vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone, etc.), Streamlit dashboards, orchestration systems, and multi-agent pipelines**.

---

## Key Features
- Large Language Model (LLM) integration  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines  
- Vector embeddings & database support  
- Prompt engineering & evaluation  
- QA-focused testing & evaluation of outputs  
- Streamlit dashboards for visualization (optional)  
- Orchestrated multi-agent workflows (MCP / orchestration frameworks)  

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd <project-folder>

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt



## Projects Overview 

1. Memory-less agentic AI system designed to:

- Evaluate prompts and LLM outputs  
- Detect inconsistencies or hallucinations  
- Automatically log results and metrics  
- Compare multiple runs for reliability  

This highlights QA skills applied to AI without relying on memory-based improvements.

## Key Features
- Prompt evaluation & scoring  
- Multi-run testing & logging  
- Hallucination detection  
- Automated output validation

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vijayk-ai/Agentic_AI_Without_Memory.git
cd Agentic_AI_Without_Memory
pip install -r requirements.txt


2. TBD 




🌱 I’m currently learning More Agentic AI concepts .....

🚀 Current focus:
- Agent frameworks (AutoGen, LangGraph)
- RAG systems
- API-based AI apps
